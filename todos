Functionalities to be added:

- automatically insert users not registered into db
	- keep in mind that users can change usernames and should be updated in 	  the db too


- create some funny pahie pics in photoshop and add a command to fetch
  a random funny pahie pic (!turnmeonpahie command)

- record some random ingame comments for each game for a future feature which enables ingame trolling
	
	- add a command like !troll[NAME OF GAME] and let pahie play a random 
	ingame call of that game so players will think the call is real


- there seems to be an issue with the !bobquote command
	-this issue has been fixed, it has todo with ffmpeg not being installed on the machine that the bot is running:
	-keep in mind for real hosting on raspberry! (ffmpeg has to be installed in order to play soundfiles!)







- MINOR BUG !summonpahie should send a message like "bot already here" if a user calls him twice in the same channel 

- MINOR ISSUE edit the messages which get returned in discord to something that makes more sense.



- OPTIMISATION comment out/refactor the whole bobquote section so it makes more sense



IDEAS: 

- could integrate "thispersondoesnotexist.com" in some way
