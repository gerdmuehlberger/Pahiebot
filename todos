- create some funny pahie pics in photoshop and add a command to fetch
  a random funny pahie pic (!turnmeonpahie command)

- record some random ingame comments for each game for a future feature which enables ingame trolling
	
	- add a command like !troll[NAME OF GAME] and let pahie play a random 
	ingame call of that game so players will think the call is real


PERSONALISED PLAYLIST
	- add functionality to delete user from db (including all saved hotkeys from user_soundfiles table)
	- add functionality to edit keywords for existing user_soundfiles entries
	- add a function as of "!pf hotkeyname" to play the favourited soundfile hotkey
	- add a function as of "!myhotkeys" to see a list of all hotkeys and corresponding soundfiles


- MINOR BUG !summonpahie should send a message like "bot already here" if a user calls him twice in the same channel 

- MINOR ISSUE edit the messages which get returned in discord to something that makes more sense.


- OPTIMISATION add a function once the troll function is deployed which lets users check which users can be trolled and which games are supported
- OPTIMISATION add better return messages of the bot (e.g. include username)
- OPTIMISATION the reddit meme function runs kinda slow and can be optimised



IDEAS: 

- could integrate "thispersondoesnotexist.com" in some way
