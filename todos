Functionalities to be added:

- automatically insert users not registered into db
	- keep in mind that users can change usernames and should be updated in 	  the db too

- !hotmemes: fetches a meme thats on hot on a meme subreddit


- there seems to be an issue with the !bobquote command
	-this issue has been fixed, it has todo with ffmpeg not being installed on the machine that the bot is running:
	-keep in mind for real hosting on raspberry! (ffmpeg has to be installed in order to play soundfiles!)

- implement proper error handling for the bobquote function

IDEAS: 

- could integrate "thispersondoesnotexist.com" in some way
