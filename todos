- automatically insert users not registered into db


- create some funny pahie pics in photoshop and add a command to fetch
  a random funny pahie pic (!turnmeonpahie command)

- record some random ingame comments for each game for a future feature which enables ingame trolling
	
	- add a command like !troll[NAME OF GAME] and let pahie play a random 
	ingame call of that game so players will think the call is real


<<<<<<< HEAD
- there seems to be an issue with the !bobquote command
	-this issue has been fixed, it has todo with ffmpeg not being installed on the machine that the bot is running:
	-keep in mind for real hosting on raspberry! (ffmpeg has to be installed in order to play soundfiles!)





- ISSUE any command can be run with a message appended atm. this shouldnt be the case (e.g. !summonpahie asdf fdsa works, while it shouldnt)

- MINOR BUG !summonpahie should send a message like "bot already here" if a user calls him twice in the same channel 

- MINOR ISSUE edit the messages which get returned in discord to something that makes more sense.



- OPTIMISATION comment out/refactor the whole bobquote section so it makes more sense
- OPTIMISATION add better return messages of the bot (e.g. include username)
- OPTIMISATION the reddit meme function runs kinda slow and can be optimised



IDEAS: 

- could integrate "thispersondoesnotexist.com" in some way
