Functionalities to be added:

- automatically insert users not registered into db
	- keep in mind that users can change usernames and should be updated in 	  the db too

- !hotmemes: fetches a meme thats on hot on a meme subreddit

- there seems to be an issue with the !bobquote command
	- it always prints "wait until current quote..."
	- console log is ffmpeg not found

IDEAS: 

- could integrate "thispersondoesnotexist.com" in some way
