- create some funny pahie pics in photoshop and add a command to fetch
  a random funny pahie pic (!turnmeonpahie command)


PERSONALISED PLAYLIST
	- add functionality to delete user from db (including all saved hotkeys from user_soundfiles table)
	- add a function as of "!pf hotkeyname" to play the favourited soundfile hotkey


- MINOR BUG !summonpahie should send a message like "bot already here" if a user calls him twice in the same channel 

- MINOR ISSUE edit the messages which get returned in discord to something that makes more sense.


- OPTIMISATION add a function once the troll function is deployed which lets users check which users can be trolled and which games are supported
- OPTIMISATION add better return messages of the bot (e.g. include username)

- OPTIMISATION the entire script has reached a point where it needs a bit of refactoring. eg. move all mysql functions to separate script and import it to clean up the whole structure.

IDEAS: 

- could integrate "thispersondoesnotexist.com" in some way
